# Tanami - Backend API

The backend for Tanami Android Application project.

The Tanami project develops an AI-based application that helps landowners determine suitable crops for their soil and climate conditions. By analyzing variables such as weather, location, and soil type, the app provides personalized recommendations to:

- Optimize land use effectively.
- Promote awareness about the importance of fiber intake for health.
- Encourage sustainable agriculture and local food production.

By democratizing access to agricultural knowledge, Tanami empowers users with limited expertise to make informed decisions about their land.
